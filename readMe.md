Binary Message Codec Project

Overview
This project, BinaryMessageCodec, is a custom implementation of a binary message encoding and decoding scheme. Designed for real-time communication applications, it focuses on efficiently handling messages composed of headers and a binary payload without relying on built-in or third-party serializer implementations.

Design and Implementation

1. Motivation Behind Design Choices

Custom Solution: Developed specifically for encoding and decoding messages in a binary format, offering control and flexibility that built-in or third-party serializers might not provide.
Efficiency and Control: Tailored to efficiently handle the specific structure of messages used in the application, optimizing both performance and space.

2. High-Level Description of the Binary Message Structure

Simple and Clear Format: A message begins with a byte indicating the number of headers, followed by each header (a key-value pair), and concludes with the payload's length and content.
Header Encoding: Each header's key and value are preceded by their lengths to ensure accurate decoding.

3. Minimalism in Scope and Complexity

Focused Implementation: The codec handles only necessary functionalities, ensuring a lightweight implementation without unnecessary features.
Straightforward Logic: The encoding and decoding processes are direct and transparent, making the code easy to understand and maintain.

4. Avoidance of Built-in or Third-Party Serializers

Custom Codec: The implementation avoids third-party libraries for serialization, using custom logic to encode and decode messages.

5. Code Quality and Simplicity

Clean and Readable Code: The code adheres to best practices in software development, ensuring readability and maintainability.
Error Handling and Logging: Robust error handling and logging (using Serilog) are implemented, ensuring the reliability of the codec.

Key Features
Custom binary encoding and decoding logic.
Externalized message constants for easy management and updates.
Configuration management using appsettings.json in an ASP.NET Core project structure.
Comprehensive NUnit tests covering both positive and negative scenarios.

Configuration and Messages

Externalized Messages (MessageConstants.cs)
Centralized location for user-facing messages, allowing for easier updates and potential localization.

Configuration Management (appsettings.json)
Configuration settings like log file paths are managed externally, following ASP.NET Core practices.
Ensures flexible application behavior adaptable to different environments.

Unit Testing

Comprehensive Tests:
The project includes NUnit tests that cover both positive and negative scenarios, ensuring the codec's robustness.
Negative Test Cases: 
Specific tests are designed to handle erroneous situations, such as oversized headers or invalid data formats, to ensure the codec behaves as expected under all conditions.

Assumptions

Header Size: Header names and values are limited to 1023 bytes.
Message Structure: Messages are assumed to contain a variable number of headers and a binary payload.
ASCII Encoding: Headers are assumed to be ASCII-encoded strings.

How to Run

Setup: Clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio. Ensure that Serilog packages are installed.
Running the Application: The main application can be run as a standard console application from Visual Studio.
Executing Unit Tests: Unit tests can be run using the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.

Configuration File Setup
File: appsettings.json.
Location: Placed in the project root; copied to the output directory during the build.
Purpose: Stores runtime configuration settings like log file paths.


Future Enhancements

Extended Character Encoding Support: Implement support for character encodings beyond ASCII if needed.
Performance Optimization: Further optimize the codec for high-frequency usage scenarios.
